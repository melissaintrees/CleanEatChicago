# Clean Eat Chicago

Clean Eat Chicago is a dining app built using Javascript, JQuery, Materalize, the City of Chicago Data Portal API, and the Google Maps API. 

It is deployed [here](https://melissaintrees.github.io/CleanEatChicago/).

### Video Demo of the App!

## Concept and Motivation

Our motivation for Clean Eat's development was the amount of great restaurants in Chicago, other major cities rating systems(Chicago doesn't have), and a reduction in hospitalization for food borne illnesses. We think that if users are able to check the Health Inspection data from their favorite Eateries, they will make better choices in where they want to dine next. We reward the passed inspections by hiding the Health Inspection Data and show the Data for failed inspections so restaurants can improve. 

### Design Notes

Clean Eat Chicago was made using the google Materialize product design framework. It incorporates Modals, Collapsibles, Parallax Scrolling, Responsive Grid Systems, and Toasts. The logo, hand created in Adobe Illustrator, has a "1970's out on the town" sort of feel to it which is incorporated intoto the rest of the app.  We wanted to make people feel hungry when they went to the site, so used Reds and Beiges.

### Further work

Future work includes setting up a Node Express server in this app and incorporating the Google Places API to display restaurant info and reviews. We want to incorporate Firebase so that users can Like and save data to restaurants.
